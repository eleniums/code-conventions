# Code Conventions
Contains style guidelines and other code conventions for various languages in one convenient spot.

The conventions detailed here are as close as possible to the official recommendations. As always, consistency within a project or organization is more important than rigid adherence to these conventions.

**If you notice something is wrong or would like to dispute a style recommendation, please submit an issue.**
